<h2>Problem</h2>
<h3>We have been tasked by the DVD Rental Co marketing team to help them generate the analytical inputs required to drive their very first customer email campaign.

The main initiative is to share insights about each customer’s viewing behaviour to demonstrate DVD Rental Co’s relentless focus on customer experience.

The insights requested by the marketing team include key statistics about each customer’s top 2 categories and favourite actor. There are also 3 personalised recommendations based off each customer’s previous viewing history as well as titles which are popular with other customers.</h3>
